## POST

This week I taught ChatGPT to read my website.

I've been building a virtual bookshelf app — curate your favorite books, podcasts, music, share them with a link.

Last week I shared a shelf with ChatGPT. Asked it what was on the page.

It couldn't see anything.

Turns out: AI assistants don't run JavaScript. My whole page was invisible to them.

A few hours of debugging later, it works. ChatGPT can now describe exactly what's on my shelves.

Wrote up what I learned (and why it matters) here: **[LINK TO ARTICLE]**

And here's this week's shelf — a few resources on web fundamentals, progressive enhancement, and building for the long term:

If you've got recommendations on web accessibility, HTML-first design, or building things that last — drop them in the comments and I'll add them.
